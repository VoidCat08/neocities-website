        <h3>Devlog 1: 06-06-2025</h3>

        <p>I haven't coded anything in over a year, so getting back into making things is rather exciting.</p>
        <p>I wasn't quite sure what I was going to do with this page, but ever since creating it about four days ago, I've been brainstorming a lot of ideas.</p>
        <p>I still have to explore this site more and check out other people's websites. From what I've seen, most of them give major Y2K vibes, while some others feel more contemporary yet still have a lot of personality.</p>
        <p>I'm not yet sure what look I'm going for, and I'm really in no rush to figure it out.</p>
        <p>I've done some cosmetic things so far, but I don't want to add too much content before I learn how to properly format webpages using CSS. IDK it just seems more efficient that way.</p>
        <p>Anyway, all of this is to say that I probably won't be updating the website daily, as I'm going to spend more time just planning and learning.</p>
