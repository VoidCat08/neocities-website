# neocities-website
A backup/version history of my neocities website. Nothing serious, just a bit of fun.


How this works:

I'm not 100% familar with github, so I'm practically jerry rigging this system to the best of my ability. Each folder you see when opening this repository is basically just a different version of my neocities website.

I'm assuming you have a vauge understanding of version history, which is about as much as I know.

So the numbers go generally go: Major.Minor.Patch

I'm not going to overwhelem this repository with every single little change I make resulting in a new folder. Typically "Patches" will just get changed and the version history will be edited to reflect that. Major and Minor updates/changes will get their own folders. Here's a breakdown of what will and what wont be counted.

"Patches" - Small minor tweaks like wording, phrasing, or small bugs
Minor - New Pages or Moderate changes to already exsisting pages
Major - Overhauls, large changes to new pages, large additions like a webgame

The sytem is likely to change as I figure this whole thing out. Although there's likely no one reading this right now.
