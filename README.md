# neocities-website
A backup/version history of my neocities website. Nothing serious, just a bit of fun.


How This Works:

I'm not 100% familiar with GitHub, so I'm basically jerry rigging this system to the best of my ability. Each folder you see when opening this repository is essentially a different version of my Neocities website.

I'm assuming you have a vague understanding of version history.

The version numbers generally follow this format: Major.Minor.Patch

I'm not going to overwhelm this repository by creating a new folder for every tiny change I make. Typically, patches will just be edited directly, and the version history will be updated to reflect that. Major and minor updates or changes will get their own folders. Here's a breakdown of what will and won’t be counted:

Patch – Small tweaks like wording, phrasing, or minor bug fixes

Minor – New pages or moderate changes to existing pages

Major – Overhauls, significant changes to multiple existing pages, or large additions like a web game

This system is likely to evolve as I figure things out. Not that anyone's probably reading this right now anyway.
