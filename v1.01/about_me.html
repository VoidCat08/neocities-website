        <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
        <p>For the sake of simplicity, you can call me Kat. Any pronouns are fine, after all, 
            we are in the void. Nothing should really exist in here.</p>
        <p>I'm an aspiring web developer, although at this point, 
            <em>"aspiring"</em> is doing a lot of the heavy lifting.</p>
        <p>I've stopped and started a lot of projects, 
            but my intentions with this website is just to carve out a little piece of the internet for myself.</p>
        <p>Right now I'm trying to figure out the basics, 
            but my goal is just to make webgames (if you can even do that on neocities). I just really do hope my site might bring joy.</p>
